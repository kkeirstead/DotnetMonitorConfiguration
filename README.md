# DotnetMonitorConfiguration

## About

The `dotnet monitor` configuration tool is designed to supplement the `dotnet monitor` diagnostic tool. This is not an official component of `dotnet monitor` and is currently considered a prototype with limited functionality and testing. For bug reports or suggestions, file an Issue on GitHub or submit a Pull Request with your proposed changes.

## Usage

The `dotnet monitor` configuration tool currently only supports doing configuration surrounding Collection Rules, a new `dotnet monitor` feature. Without needing to manually write any JSON configuration, the tool provides a template for easily configuring Collection Rules and copying the auto-generated JSON into your own configuration file. You can also begin with an existing configuration; the tool can interpret your JSON and allows you to make changes to it.

## Future Support

The `dotnet monitor` configuration tool is currently a low priority and is not being regularly updated. As a result, at any given time there may be missing or broken functionality as `dotnet monitor` receives updates.

## License

The DotnetMonitorConfiguration tool is licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE.TXT) license.
